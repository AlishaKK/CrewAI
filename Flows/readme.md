### **Agentic System**  
A system that independently makes decisions and takes actions to achieve goals.  

- **Agent:**  
  - Self-directed and autonomous.  
  - Dynamically selects LLMs/tools.  
  - Makes real-time decisions to complete tasks.  

- **Workflow:**  
  - Follows predefined steps, not autonomous.  
  - Uses pre-selected LLMs/tools controlled by code.  
  - Executes fixed paths to complete tasks.

### **CrewAI**  
A framework that enables AI agents to collaborate and solve problems as a team.  

#### **Core Components of CrewAI:**  
1. **Crew** â€“ The leader that organizes the team and manages the workflow.  
2. **AI Agents** â€“ Specialized workers (e.g., researcher, writer) handling tasks.  
3. **Process** â€“ The workflow system that assigns tasks and ensures smooth execution.  
4. **Tasks** â€“ Small steps that collectively achieve the main goal.  

#### **Flows in CrewAI:**  
Structured frameworks that integrate tasks and Crews to design, execute, and manage AI workflows seamlessly.
