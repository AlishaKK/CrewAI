Agentic System:
 A system that independently makes decisions and takes actions to achieve goals.
	Agent: 
Self-directed, autonomous.
LLMs/tools are chosen dynamically.
Make real-time decisions to complete tasks.

	Workflow: 

Predefined steps, not autonomous.
LLMs/tools are pre-selected and controlled by code.
Follow fixed paths to complete tasks.



CrewAI :
      A framework that makes it easy for AI agents to collaborate and solve problems as a team.

Core Components of CrewAI:
1.	Crew: The leader that sets up the team and manages the plan.
2.	AI Agents: Workers with special skills (e.g., researcher, writer) who handle tasks.
3.	Process: The workflow system that assigns tasks and keeps the team on track.
4.	Tasks: Small steps that add up to finish the main goal.

Flows in CrewAI:
Flows in CrewAI are organized frameworks that combine tasks and Crews to design, execute, and manage AI workflows seamlessly.
